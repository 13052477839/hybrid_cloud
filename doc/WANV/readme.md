# WAN Virtualization

## 1. Introduction
### What is it?
Huawei proprietary solution based on commodity x86-based appliance for aggregating multiple low-cost WAN links to interconnect branches, remote offices and data centers
### Business case:
* Reduce OPEX by replacing lease lines (e.g. MPLS) with multiple low-cost DSL links
* Enabler for enterprise hybrid cloud

### What it can do?
* Optimal link utilization
* Path protection & aggregation
* Flow-based load balancing
* Flow-based QoS/COS
* HA
* Extend local LAN to remote sites with secured tunneling (GRE or VxLAN over IPSec)

### Differentiators
* SDN application
* Unlimited links with live network performance monitoring
* Dynamic policies
* Optimized and predictive routing (based on machine learning)
